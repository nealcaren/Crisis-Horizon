<ul>
<li>Crisis Horizon seeks to reprint foundational work in the field of
sociology. The focus is on articles that can provide valuable insights
both into understanding the development of sociology but also our
analysis of contemporary social issues. We publish works unavailable in
large academic archives, such as JSTOR.</li>
<li>All publications are formatted in markdown and converted to HTML
using modified versions of <a href="https://kieranhealy.org">Kieran
Healy’s</a> <a href="https://github.com/kjhealy/pandoc-templates">Pandoc
templates.</a>.</li>
<li>The name <span class="small-caps">Crisis Horizon</span> is inspired
by two of the journals created and edited by W.EB. Du Bois. <em>The
Horizon</em>, associated with the Niagara Movement, was published
between 1907 and 1910. Du Bois subsequently founded <em>The Crisis</em>,
the official journal of the NAACP, in 1910 and was its editor until
1934.</li>
<li>Artwork on the homepage is created with the prompt “abstract Harlem
renaissance black and white woodcut by Aaron Douglas” using OpenAI’s
Dall-E.</li>
<li>Each of the works on this site is believed to be in the public
domain. Feel free to copy, share, repurpose, and remix. If you think
we’ve made a mistake, let <a href="neal.caren@unc.edu">me</a> know.</li>

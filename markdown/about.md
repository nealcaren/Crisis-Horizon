* Crisis Horizon seeks to reprint foundational work in the field of sociology. The focus is on articles that can provide valuable insights both into understanding the development of sociology but also our analysis of contemporary social issues. We publish works unavailable in large academic archives, such as JSTOR. 
* All publications are formatted in markdown and converted to HTML using modified versions of [Kieran Healy's](https://kieranhealy.org) [Pandoc templates.](https://github.com/kjhealy/pandoc-templates).
* The name <span class="small-caps">Crisis Horizon</span> is inspired by two of the journals created and edited by W.EB. Du Bois. *The Horizon*, associated with the Niagara Movement, was published between 1907 and 1910. Du Bois subsequently founded *The Crisis*, the official journal of the NAACP, in 1910 and was its editor until 1934.
* Artwork on the homepage is created with the prompt "abstract Harlem renaissance black and white woodcut by Aaron Douglas" using OpenAI's Dall-E.
